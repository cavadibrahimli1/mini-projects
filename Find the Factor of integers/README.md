# Find the Factor of positive integers 


We can tell if a number is a factor of another number by checking if the second number evenly divides the first number. For example, 7 is a factor of 21 because 21 Ã· 7 is 3. This also gives us another of 21â€™s factors: 3. However, 8 is not a factor of 21 because 21 Ã· 8 = 2.625. The fractional remainder component tells us this equation did not divide evenly. The % mod operator will perform division and tell us if thereâ€™s a remain-
der: 21 % 7 evaluates to 0, meaning there is no remainder and 7 is a factor of 21, whereas 21 % 8 evaluates to 1, a nonzero value, meaning that it isnâ€™t a factor. The factor finder program uses this technique on line 35 to determine which numbers are factors. The math.sqrt() function returns the square root of the number passed
to it. For example, math.sqrt(25) returns 5.0 because 5 times itself is 25, mak-
ing it the square root of 25.
